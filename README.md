# DC2

Welcome to the second LSST DESC data challenge project, DC2! We are aiming to simulate 300 sq deg of LSST imaging over a 10 year campaign in 6 filters, to provide a legacy dataset that supports a wide range of investigations, initially within the collaboration but later (we hope) the rest of the LSST community.

The repository contains all of the issues, tools and validations used for the DC2 simulated dataset production, and the Notes and papers that describe the DC2 production strategy and techniques, and record our methods and findings.
